Selecting All Data
==================

To select all data from a table in the database, the user will need to input the name of the desired table.
To prevent errors, check the Database ERD for the correct spelling of the table name. This will then call the `dbManager` class and run
the `selectAll` method.

This will return all the data stored in the queried table.
